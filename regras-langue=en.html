Transformice moderators will always do our very best to ensure that players have the best gaming experience possible, but we rely on you, the players, to help us catch rule breakers. Sanctions range from a warning to a permanent ban. Keep in mind that your past warnings, mutes, and bans can be viewed by every moderator, and repeat offenders may find that they have been given a higher sanction. Unfortunately, it’s not entirely possible to list every possible situation that could be against the rules. There may be issues missing from this list that warrant a punishment, but you’ll typically be given a warning before any action is taken.<br />Respect your fellow mice and play fair. Have fun!<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">CHEAT</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Cheating / Cheating on an alt account / Asking for cheats / Giving out cheats</p><br />Any form of hacking (aka &#39;cheating&#39; by using a third party program to gain advantages) will NOT be tolerated and can result in a PERMANENT ban. So you better think twice before you start flying across the room like Supermouse, because you will lose your account! Don&#39;t even think about using a different account to cheat -- we will find you! Linking to cheats and/or asking for cheats are also against the rules and can result in a mute or ban from the game.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">CHAT</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Spam/Flood / Caps-lock abuse / Advertising / General vulgarity / Inappropriate or vulgar links / Severe insulting / Insults to the staff / Misleading players / Provocation / Promoting trollish topics / Xenophobia / Wrong languages in chat</p><br />Racial, homophobic, religious, or any other discrimination is not tolerated. Using derogatory terms, even in jest, is not allowed and will result in a mute or ban from the game.<br />Do not share any inappropriate sites or any illegal content. Only trust websites that start with http://transformice.com/ and within the Transformice site. Please do not share your personal information with any players (examples: email, full name, facebook profile, phone numbers, etc). Likewise, if you are caught sharing the private or personal information of another player without their consent it can result in a mute or a ban.<br />EN is divided into two communities:<br />-EN1 is considered an international community which means that players from all countries are allowed to play here. Moderators may warn or mute players that aren&#39;t speaking English only if they are severely disrupting the chat and they have a community they can return to. For the players that do not have a home community, we ask that you ignore them by typing /ignore (name).  <br />-EN2 is English only and it is strictly enforced. Any player speaking a language other than English will be redirected to their home community or EN1. <br />Please keep in mind that speaking English in communities other than EN1 or EN2 can result in a warning or mute.<br /><br />Remember, young children also play this game. Language which seems natural for you may not be suitable for them.  If you wouldn’t say it in front of your mother you probably shouldn’t say it here!<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">ACCOUNTS</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Phishing / Staff Impersonation / Inappropriate names</p><br />Phishing is the process of trying to scam players into giving you their personal information (such as their password or phone number) by offering them cheese, fraises, or any other type of award.  Any attempts to acquire such information (whether it be via linking to an external website, impersonating a moderator, or even simply asking over chat) can result in a permanent ban from this game.<br />Claiming to be a staff member in the chat can result in a mute and you may be banned if you do not heed our warnings in the future. Please don’t create accounts that are meant to impersonate staff or that contain vulgar or offensive language. By doing so you risk losing that account forever!<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">MAPS</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Crash Maps / Offensive Maps / Copy Maps</p><br />Please do not create any maps that are inappropriate, offensive, or can cause other players to lag or crash. Most crash maps are considered accidental and are simply removed from the rotation; however, if it appears that you’ve created the map intentionally (e.g., a lava box with 20 anvils) it will be deleted and you may be banned.<br />Copy maps are simply removed from the rotation, but if it’s been discovered that you are stealing XMLs or trying to pass off the work of others as your own you run the risk of having all of your maps deleted and being put on the Map Crew’s “blacklist”, meaning all of your maps will be deleted and your future (original) maps will not be considered for perm status.<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">TOTEM</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Offensive Totem / Crash Totem</p><br />Do not create any totems that are offensive or could cause other players to lag or crash. If you intentionally create an offensive totem (e.g. swastikas) or a crash totem (e.g. anvil/box god), be prepared to receive a ban.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">EVASION</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Mute evasion / Ban evasion</p><br />Evading a ban or mute will result in a higher punishment. If you feel that you were punished unfairly it is best to contact a moderator. The fastest way to reach us is through our IRC channels (#transformice, #transformicefr).<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">ROOMKICK</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Roomkick abuse / Roomkick as a game</p><br />It can be used to kick players out for minor offenses (e.g., trolling, favoring, glitch abuse, rule breaking in minigame rooms).  It shouldn&#39;t be used to punish mice that &quot;steal&quot; your firsts, or a new shaman trying to learn, so please use it responsibly. Rallying your tribe or a group of players together for the purpose of kicking innocent players from a room is considered abuse and may result in a ban from a moderator. Room kick “lotteries” where players kick each other for fun is also regarded as abuse and is strictly prohibited.<br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">OTHERS</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Glitch abuse / Crashing a room when shaman  / Leaking or sharing private information relevant to the game</p><br />Please note that exploiting glitches is not advised since it gives you an unfair advantage over other players. Depending on the glitch you could be warned/banned by a moderator or votebanned by the room. Exploiting certain glitches can result in your removal from minigame rooms or even the cheese.formice.com leaderboard. You can report new glitches to the bugs section of the forum. <br /><br />If you are crashing a room intentionally (ex: with an anvil god) you&#39;ll be kicked from the game.<br /><br />Staff members know a few more things than a usual player and you will probably hear some of this information one day. Leaking or sharing this type of information is prohibited.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:50px;">MORE INFORMATION</span></span></p><br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">TROLLING</span></span></p><br />Trolling is part of the game. Mad that your shaman blocked your hole? Did he fool around with a few ghost planks? Is someone not following the rules of a mini-game? Is a naughty mouse constantly stalling? Did your shaman just balloon his friend to first? While moderators won&#39;t do anything about trolling since it does not break any game rules, if these players happen to get on your nerves, you have all rights to voteban.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">PRIVATE ROOMS</span></span></p><br />A private room is private. It&#39;s your room and you can do (almost) whatever you want in it! We won&#39;t moderate your chat and you are free to voteban any unwanted guests. However, we WILL moderate your room if someone is hacking in it, if we notice a ban lottery going on, or if multiple people in the room are reporting certain players in it. Please keep in mind that numbered rooms, minigame rooms, and popular non-numbered rooms such as /room cheese, /room noob, etc. are NOT considered private due to the amount of players from all over that circulate through each day. If you aren&#39;t sure whether or not the room you are in is private please ask a moderator.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">MINIGAMES</span></span></p><br />Moderators will not deal with minigame rulebreakers (such as huggers in survivor) so please do not call us to do so. However, feel free to contact us if players are breaking any of the game rules listed above. If you have a complaint about a particular minigame please contact the person running it.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">MUTING</span></span></p><br /><p style="text-align:center;">Muting players / Muting tribe chat / Language filter</p><br />/mute and /ignore allow you to ignore every message from a player (even whispers). It is impossible to abuse this command since the only person affected is you.  Mute a whole room if you’d like! To unignore someone all you have to do is relog. /mt allows you to mute your tribe chat if your tribemates are being naughty or if you just want less chat spam. To unmute your tribe simply type /mt again. Moderators will not moderate your whispers or your tribe chat so please take advantage of these helpful commands.<br />/filtre can be use to enable and disable the (inappropriate) language filter. Please note that filter is simply here to protect users from insults; insulting users will still have the same concequences.<br /><br /><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:soopafresh;"><span style="font-size:30px;">PASSWORD</span></span></p><br />Do not share your account or your password with ANYONE, not even a moderator! Use a strong password that contains numbers and letters and change it frequently to lower your risk of a security breach. Write it down somewhere so you don’t forget it.  Do not forget to register an email to your account. If someone guesses your password and you don’t have an email attached to it they will be able to register your account to THEIR email and change your password whenever they want. If someone is asking you for your password, contact a moderator immediately. If you think your account has already been compromised, please use the transformice contact form located at transformice.com/contact.<br /><br /><b><span style="color:#6C77C1;">Changes to these rules will be atualized by a <span style="color:#eb1d51;">administrator</span> responsible of your community here.
